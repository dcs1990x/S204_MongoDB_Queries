# Sprint 2, Task 4: MongoDB Queries

This repository contains the solutions to a series of exercises focused on practicing MongoDB queries using the Restaurants collection of New York City.

## üíª Technologies

- MongoDB 7.0+
- Mongo Shell or MongoDB Compass
- No external libraries required

## üìò Project Overview

The task consists of implementing a collection of MongoDB queries that:

- Retrieve all documents and specific fields from the Restaurants collection   
- Apply projections to include/exclude fields   
- Filter documents by borough, cuisine, grades, or geographical coordinates   
- Use operators such as $and, $or, $not, comparison operators, and regular expressions   
- Sort results in ascending/descending order   
- Perform queries on nested fields and arrays   

The set of exercises provides practice with basic queries, conditional operators, sorting, regex-based filtering, and working with embedded documents/arrays.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices Followed

- Consistent use of projections to optimize query results
- Combination of operators for precise filtering
- Sorting for improved readability of outputs
- Modular structure, easy to test and adapt to new requirements

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

- Clone the repository
- Open MongoDB Shell or Compass
- Import the Task_4 - queries.json dataset into your MongoDB instance
- Copy and run the queries provided in the project
